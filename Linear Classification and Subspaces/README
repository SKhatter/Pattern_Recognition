This project involves the writing of PCA, LDA and a Naive Bayes Classifier.  PCA is used for data compression and LDA as a linear classifier. Functions that do Eigen decomposition, basic vector and matrix functions and the SVD are used but any functions that implement PCA, LDA, or linear classification are not used.
